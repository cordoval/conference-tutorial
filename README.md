# Symfony CMF Conference Website Tutorial

This is a step by step tutorial how to build a real application with the
[Symfony2 CMF](http://cmf.symfony.com). Each step is explained as a pull
request against the previous step.

If you are interested in having me do a CMF tutorial for you, please get in
[contact](mailto:mail@davidbu.ch).

## Documentation

The master branch is the Symfony2 Standard Edition without the DemoBundle. It
has no routes configured and will give you a 404 for the homepage. See the
branches and pull requests for the actual data.

For further information and setup instructions, see the [project wiki](https://github.com/dbu/conference-tutorial/wiki/Home)
and the pull requests.
